### Recommended Initial Steps to Actualizing PyScrAI

A recommended roadmap, broken down into manageable phases, focusing on getting an MVP operational:

#### Phase 1: Core Backend & Data Layer (Minimal Viable Engine)

1.  **Project Setup & Version Control:**
    *   Initialize a Python project.
    *   Set up a Git repository (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).

2.  **Data Layer (Python + ORM/NoSQL Client):**
    *   Define your core data models in Python (Actor, Event, Action, SimulationState).
    *   **Choose a persistence layer:**
        *   **Firestore (recommended for MVP due to flexibility and scalability):** Use the `google-cloud-firestore` Python client library. This aligns well with your "flexible JSON-like documents" idea.
        *   **SQLite (for pure local dev simplicity):** Use Python's built-in `sqlite3` module or an ORM like SQLAlchemy for initial rapid prototyping.
    *   Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Actors, Events, and the main SimulationState.

3.  **LLM Bridge (Abstract Interface):**
    *   Create the `LLMClient` class as outlined in your blueprint.
    *   Implement a concrete provider for **one** LLM, e.g., OpenAI or OpenRouter (using `requests` or their respective SDKs). Focus on basic text generation first.

4.  **Phase Engine (Python Logic):**
    *   Implement the core `PhaseEngine` logic.
    *   Start with a simple function or class that can:
        *   Load the current `SimulationState`.
        *   Advance through phases (initialize, event, action, resolve, snapshot).
        *   Integrate placeholder functions for LLM interactions (initially, these can return dummy data or simple scripted responses).
    *   Implement the `Snapshot` functionality.

5.  **Basic Scripted Scenario:**
    *   Create a simple `scenario_module.py` that can:
        *   Define initial actors and their attributes.
        *   Generate some basic programmatic events.

6.  **Zeus Mode (Initial CLI):**
    *   Implement a command-line interface (CLI) to:
        *   Start/load a simulation.
        *   Manually advance phases.
        *   Print the current world state, actors, events, and pending actions (your basic Zeus Mode for debugging).
        *   Manually inject player actions.

#### Phase 2: Web UI & API Layer (MVP User Experience)

1.  **API Layer (Python Framework):**
    *   **Choose a micro-framework:**
        *   **Flask (recommended for simplicity and speed):** Lightweight, easy to get started with.
        *   FastAPI (excellent for performance, automatic OpenAPI docs, and async operations, but a slightly steeper learning curve than Flask).
    *   Expose endpoints for:
        *   Getting the current simulation state.
        *   Submitting player actions.
        *   Advancing phases.
        *   Reviewing/confirming events (for researcher mediation).

2.  **Frontend (React/Vue/Svelte):**
    *   **Project Setup:** Initialize a new web project (e.g., using Create React App, Vite, or a similar tool).
    *   **Core UI Components:**
        *   **Dashboard:** Display current phase, basic simulation stats.
        *   **Event Review Panel:** List pending events, provide "Confirm" buttons.
        *   **Action Submission Panel:** A text area for player input.
        *   **Phase Control:** Buttons for "Advance Phase," "Snapshot."
    *   **Map Integration:**
        *   Integrate Leaflet.js (or similar) into your UI.
        *   Display a basic map (OSM tiles).
        *   Place markers for visible actors. Initially, don't worry about custom overlays or complex popouts, just markers.

#### Phase 3: LLM Integration & Refinement

1.  **Prompt Engineering:**
    *   Focus on crafting effective prompts for your `LLMClient` methods:
        *   `generate_events`: Provide current world state, context, and ask for environmental or minor NPC events.
        *   `parse_actions`: Take player free-text, world state, and ask for structured `Action` suggestions (e.g., JSON output).
        *   `resolve_actions`: Input all pending actions, world state, and ask for resulting `Event` descriptions and state changes.
    *   Use Google AI Studio's "Build" feature *here* to experiment with prompts, test different LLMs, and refine the output structure for your `LLMClient`. This is where AI Studio will be invaluable.

2.  **Researcher Mediation UI:**
    *   Enhance the "Event Review" panel to allow researchers to edit LLM-generated event descriptions and effects before confirmation.
    *   Add similar functionality for reviewing parsed player actions and potentially editing the `parsedOptions`.

#### Phase 4: Enhancements & Scaling

1.  **Deployment:**
    *   Deploy your backend API (e.g., Google Cloud Run, Vercel for serverless functions, or a simple VM).
    *   Deploy your frontend (e.g., Google Cloud Storage with CDN, Netlify, Vercel).
    *   Set up your Firestore database in Google Cloud.

2.  **Advanced Map Features:**
    *   Custom image overlays.
    *   Hover/popout info for markers.
    *   Visibility rules based on scenario modules.

3.  **NPC Action Generation:**
    *   Integrate LLM calls into the `Action Stage` for generating major NPC intents.
    *   Implement Zeus Mode visibility for these pending NPC actions.

4.  **Scenario Module System:**
    *   Formalize the interface for scenario modules to inject initial state, programmatic events, and potentially custom resolution logic.

5.  **Error Handling & Logging:**
    *   Robust error handling across all layers.
    *   Comprehensive logging for debugging and audit trails.
