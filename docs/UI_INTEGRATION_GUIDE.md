# UI Integration Complete! 🎉

## What's New

The ScrAI frontend has been fully enhanced to utilize the new LLM-powered backend features. All components are ready and integrated.

## Components Created/Enhanced

### ✅ New Components
1. **SimulationDashboard.tsx** - Comprehensive tabbed dashboard with 5 views (Overview, Events, Actions, Actors, Logs)
2. **EventViewer.tsx** - Color-coded event display with type/status indicators
3. **ActionViewer.tsx** - Priority-based action viewer with outcome display

### ✅ Enhanced Components
4. **PhaseLogViewer.tsx** - Now accepts props, shows phase icons, color-coded borders
5. **ActorManager.tsx** - Displays traits, skills, location, role with emoji icons

### ✅ Type System Updates
6. **types/api.ts** - Added 8 enums (EventType, EventStatus, ActionType, ActionStatus, ActionPriority, ActorType, SimulationStatus, SimulationPhase)
7. **Enhanced interfaces** - EventDetail, ActionDetail with all LLM fields

## How to Test

### 1. Start Backend API
```bash
python run_api.py
```

### 2. Start Frontend Dev Server
```bash
cd web
npm run dev
```

### 3. Open Browser
Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL shown in terminal)

### 4. Create a Simulation
1. Click "Create Simulation" in the form
2. Enter name (e.g., "Test Town")
3. Select scenario: **simple_town**
4. Click "Create"

### 5. Explore the Dashboard

#### Overview Tab
- **Metrics Cards**: See current phase, actor count, pending events/actions
- **Simulation Details**: Name, scenario, status, timestamps
- **Phase History**: Last 10 phases executed
- **Recent Activity**: Latest phase notes preview

#### Events Tab
- Watch for LLM-generated events to appear
- Color coding by type (social=blue, environmental=green, etc.)
- Status badges (pending→confirmed→resolved)
- Click to expand for full details

#### Actions Tab
- See actor actions with priority borders (urgent=red, high=orange)
- Action type icons (🚶💬🤝💰👥⚔️🔬📋)
- Outcome panel showing LLM resolution results
- Expandable metadata

#### Actors Tab
- View all simulation actors
- See traits (leadership: high), skills ([teaching]), location (📍 Town Hall)
- Edit/delete actors
- Create new actors

#### Logs Tab
- Detailed phase execution timeline
- Phase-specific icons (🚀⚡📥⚙️🌍📸)
- Color-coded borders by phase type
- Notes from LLM processing ("Generated 3 events", "Resolved 2 actions")

### 6. Advance Through Phases

Click the "Advance Phase" button to progress the simulation:

1. **Initialize** → Scenario is seeded with actors and initial events
2. **Event Generation** → LLM generates new emergent events
3. **Action Collection** → System gathers pending actions
4. **Action Resolution** → LLM resolves actions, updates actors, generates consequence events
5. **World Update** → LLM applies event effects to actors
6. **Snapshot** → State is recorded
7. **Loop back to Event Generation**

After each phase advance:
- Check the **Events tab** for new LLM-generated events
- Check the **Actions tab** for resolved actions with outcomes
- Check the **Actors tab** for updated traits/skills/locations
- Check the **Logs tab** for detailed phase notes

## Visual Indicators

### Color Coding

**Event Types:**
- 🔵 **Social** (blue-100): "Village meeting held"
- 🟢 **Environmental** (green-100): "Rain affects harvest"
- 🟡 **Economic** (yellow-100): "Market prices rise"
- 🟣 **Political** (purple-100): "Election announced"
- ⚫ **System** (gray-100): "Simulation paused"

**Event Status:**
- 🟡 **Pending** (yellow badge): Awaiting processing
- 🔵 **Confirmed** (blue badge): Validated and active
- 🟢 **Resolved** (green badge): Completed
- 🔴 **Cancelled** (red badge): Invalidated

**Action Priority (left border):**
- 🔴 **Urgent** (red-300): Critical actions
- 🟠 **High** (orange-300): Important
- 🔵 **Normal** (blue-300): Standard
- ⚫ **Low** (gray-300): Background

**Phase Types (border color in logs):**
- **Initialize**: Gray
- **Event Generation**: Purple
- **Action Collection**: Blue
- **Action Resolution**: Orange
- **World Update**: Green
- **Snapshot**: Cyan

## Expected LLM Behavior

When you advance phases, the LLM will:

1. **Event Generation Phase**:
   - First cycle: Seeds scenario (creates initial actors, events)
   - Later cycles: Generates emergent events based on simulation state
   - Example: "The village elder calls for a town meeting to discuss the recent drought"

2. **Action Resolution Phase**:
   - Resolves each pending action
   - Generates outcome descriptions
   - Updates actor attributes (traits, skills)
   - May change actor locations
   - Can generate consequence events
   - Example: "Sarah successfully teaches the children about farming techniques. Her teaching skill improves."

3. **World Update Phase**:
   - Applies event effects to actors
   - Updates world state based on events
   - Example: "The town meeting event increases community cohesion for all participants"

## Troubleshooting

### No Events Showing
- Make sure you've advanced past the INITIALIZE phase
- Check the Logs tab to verify Event Generation phase completed
- Ensure LLM service is configured (OpenRouter API key in settings.toml)

### Actions Not Resolving
- Verify you're in or past ACTION_RESOLUTION phase
- Check backend logs for LLM errors
- Ensure actions have valid actor_id and type

### Dashboard Not Updating
- Check that polling is active (should auto-start)
- Verify activeSimulation is set (select simulation from list)
- Check browser console for API errors

### Styling Issues
- Ensure TailwindCSS is properly configured
- Check for dark mode conflicts
- Verify all component imports are correct

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **WebSocket Integration**: Replace polling with real-time updates
2. **Timeline View**: Visualize event/action sequences chronologically
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Charts for actor stats, event distributions
4. **Export Features**: Download simulation narrative as text/JSON
5. **Filtering/Search**: Filter events/actions by type, status, actor

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create simulation with simple_town scenario
- [ ] Verify Overview metrics display correctly
- [ ] Advance through all phases
- [ ] Check Events tab shows color-coded events
- [ ] Check Actions tab shows resolved actions with outcomes
- [ ] Check Actors tab displays traits/skills/locations
- [ ] Check Logs tab shows detailed phase notes
- [ ] Test dark mode toggle
- [ ] Test responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## API Endpoints Used

The dashboard integrates with these backend endpoints:

- `GET /api/simulations/{id}` - Fetch simulation detail
- `POST /api/simulations` - Create simulation
- `POST /api/simulations/{id}/advance` - Advance phase
- `POST /api/simulations/{id}/actors` - Create actor
- `PUT /api/simulations/{id}/actors/{actor_id}` - Update actor
- `DELETE /api/simulations/{id}/actors/{actor_id}` - Delete actor

All endpoints return JSON with full LLM-generated data (events, action outcomes, actor attributes, phase notes).

## Success Criteria

✅ **You know the UI integration is working when:**

1. **Overview tab** shows accurate real-time metrics
2. **Events tab** displays LLM-generated events with proper color coding
3. **Actions tab** shows action outcomes from LLM resolution
4. **Actors tab** displays updated traits/skills after phase progression
5. **Logs tab** shows detailed phase notes including LLM operations
6. All tabs update automatically when advancing phases
7. Dark mode works across all components
8. Responsive layout adapts to different screen sizes

Enjoy exploring your LLM-powered social simulations! 🚀
